Create a Vite+ReactJS project with a component that can be used to make liquid glass effect containers.
Learn from https://github.com/MAbdullahAhmad/ReactJS-Liquid-Glass and make me a page with navbar fixed in glass effect. other page simple.

Also a long-press toggle dark mode and light mode switch as well.

Create in project dir

remember to use:
- a .env
- package.json scripts
- build and serve build scripts

remember my coding steyl i.e,
- use snake_case instead of camal case.
- use function based components.
- use .env in root
- in src, use components dir as well
- you can use a simple bootstrap library with inter font to add sections for testing the header.
