the internl blurr inside header doees not look cool. make changes:
1. reduce widht. only use fit-content
2. remove these double glass effects. only single liquid-glass  this should look single identity.
3. for settings. set 0.2 blurr. and increase border radius. with a transition on:hover increase transition.
4. simiilarly for dark mode. do not add bg. liquid glass effect itself is a background
5. use icons, with nice animation on switch.
