add .gitignore. and make sure for glass effect there is single component only that is used as parent in order to use effect. with important 3-4 configs only and having a default also

Also there is mistake in overall design:
- only header will have liquid glass background
- and a theme toggle on bottom left that has fixed position will have this effect
- nothing else will have effect
- website will have 13 sections. one dark one light. some text some imeages (svg diagonal). etc.
